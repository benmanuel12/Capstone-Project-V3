# Categorising and Predicting Most Valuable Business Traveller Category(s)

---
## Executive Summary
My business problem that I am solving is to find out which of the people represented in my data set fit into distinct categories, and what are the distinguishing features of those categories. I also want to use machine learning to predict how valuable a customer would be based on the value of one or more columns to be predicted based on the other columns values, and potentially therefore which columns/features contribute most to value.

## Introduction

chose this research question and why it is a strong candidate for a data-driven
solution

The background for this problem is 

I chose this research question because I believed that it was a question that could be answered using my dataset, but was detailed enough to be worthwhile applying machine learning to the problem. I am also personally invested in finding out the results of the analysis as the dataset is too dense to be analysed by hand
There are very useful points for figuring out who is most likely to do lots of travelling, be prone to spending, how rich they potentially are, such as country of residence, age, remote working, frequency of business travel, level of education, job title and what they would be willing to spend on to upgrade travel.
I am hoping that this would hypothetically allow someone to target the best people for upselling services or items.
I believe this is a strong candidate for a data-driven solution because the overall subjective problem has been broken down into many smaller non-subjective problems with categorical answers.
